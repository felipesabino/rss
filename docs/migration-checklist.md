# Migration Checklist

## Page QA Results
- `/` (Home): Hero, highlight cards, and CTA buttons match the Next.js page; Tailwind/shadcn styles preserved; React island renders correctly in Astro.
- `/dashboard`: Header/nav shell and overview cards mirror the Next.js dashboard page; user slug displays from session helper (demo defaults currently); nav links point to the same dashboard subpaths (feeds/reports/saved) pending further page builds.
