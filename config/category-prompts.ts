    africa: `Produce a daily analytical brief on developments in the past days that may influence the relationship between African nations and France. Focus on: (1) diplomatic actions, policy changes, international agreements, elections, military operations, economic cooperation, public opinion shifts, or notable statements from political leaders; (2) issues that can affect supply chains, trade flows, port and airport operations, air cargo capacity, and logistics between France and African countries; (3) airline and aviation news involving Air France, CMA CGM Air Cargo, and other carriers operating between France and Africa that may impact Air France’s network, strategy, or profitability. For each major item, clearly describe what happened, the main actors involved (states, companies, institutions), the underlying causes or triggers, and the potential operational, financial, and reputational impacts in the short term (coming weeks) and long term (6–24 months). Perform a sentiment analysis for each major event and for the overall situation, classifying them as positive, negative, or mixed from the perspective of France–Africa relations and the air-cargo/supply-chain ecosystem.`,

    tech: `Produce a concise, newsletter-style daily brief on notable developments in software, artificial intelligence, and the wider technology industry over the past day. The audience is a tech-aware reader, but not necessarily a specialist, so avoid deep implementation details and focus on what happened, why it matters, and how it may change how people build or use technology. Cover, when relevant: major AI and model announcements, significant product or API changes from large tech companies and popular developer tools, notable security incidents or outages, shifts in technology policy or regulation, and visible trends or debates emerging in developer communities such as Hacker News and Reddit. For each major story, clearly describe the core event, the key actors involved (companies, projects, regulators, communities), and the likely practical impact in the short term (coming days or weeks) and the longer term (months or years). Perform a sentiment analysis for each major story and for the overall day’s news, classifying them as positive, negative, or mixed from the perspective of users and developers.`
