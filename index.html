                        The article discusses Strobelight, a performance profiling tool developed by Meta, which helps engineers identify and fix performance issues in their code. Here are some key points about Strobelight:

**What is Strobelight?**

Strobelight is a performance profiler that provides detailed information about the performance of code, including CPU cycles, memory allocation, and other metrics.

**Key Features:**

1. **Query Language:** Strobelight has a query language (Scuba) that allows users to extract data from the profiling results.
2. **Visualizations:** The tool provides various visualizations, such as flame graphs, pie charts, and time series graphs, to help users understand complex performance data.
3. **Delayd Symbolization:** Strobelight delays symbolization until after profiling to prevent memory thrashing on the host machine.
4. **Frame Pointers:** Meta&#39;s user space binaries include frame pointers, which enables Strobelight to walk the call stack and extract performance data.

**Tools:**

1. **Scuba:** A query language database and UI that provides a large suite of visualizations for users.
2. **Tracery:** A trace visualization tool used at Meta to combine correlated streams of profile data on one screen.
3. **Crochet Profiler:** Combines service request spans, CPU-cycles stacks, and off-CPU data to provide a detailed snapshot of performance.

**Real-World Impact:**

Strobelight has helped engineers at Meta catch performance regressions, identify computationally expensive code patterns, and optimize their code for better performance. One notable example is &#34;The Biggest Ampersand,&#34; where a single character change fixed an unintentional array copy in C++ code that saved an estimated 15,000 servers in capacity.

**Future Plans:**

1. **Open-Sourcing:** The Strobelight team is working on open-sourcing the profilers and libraries to make them more robust and useful.
2. **Collaboration with Engineers:** The team will continue to work closely with Meta&#39;s performance engineers to develop new features that better analyze code.

Overall, Strobelight is a powerful tool for identifying and fixing performance issues in code, and its collaboration with engineers has led to significant gains in terms of capacity savings and optimization.
